# Multi Image Bird Classification with Inception V3 Model
## Overview
This project utilizes the Inception V3 model for multi-image bird classification. The Inception V3 model, known for its deep architecture and efficient training, has been fine-tuned to accurately classify different bird species based on input images.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pillow
Any additional requirements specified by TensorFlow and its dependencies.

## Evaluation
The evaluation script (evaluate.py) assesses the model's performance on the test set, providing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results
Include details about the model's performance, such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and any insights gained during evaluation.
